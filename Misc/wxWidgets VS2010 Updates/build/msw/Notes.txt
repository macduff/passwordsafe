The file "wxBuild_wxWidgets.bat" in this directory has been updated to compile
V2.8.10 of wxWidgest for VS2010 (Visual C++ complier 10.0)

Note: PasswordSafe wxWidgets uses the static Unicode libraries only, although the
following will also build the Unicode DLLs.

You should issue the following commands in a command window in this order:

wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 CLEAN

wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL LIB_DEBUG_UNICODE
wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL LIB_RELEASE_UNICODE
wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL DLL_DEBUG_UNICODE
wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL DLL_RELEASE_UNICODE

wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 MOVE
wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 CLEAN

The resulting libraries will be placed in the correct vc10_lib and vc10_dll (the VS2005
equivalents remain in directories vc_lib and vc_dll.

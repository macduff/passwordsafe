The file "wxBuild_wxWidgets.bat" in this directory has been updated to compile
V2.8.11 of wxWidgets for VS2010 (Visual C++ complier 10.0) for 32-bit and 64-bit
projects.

This file is based on that provided by RJP Computing as part of the wxPack project
(see: http://wxpack.sourceforge.net/).  It has been updated to support VS2010 and
also 64-bit compilations for VS2005, VS2008 and VS2010.

Note: PasswordSafe wxWidgets uses the static Unicode libraries only, although the
following will also build the Unicode DLLs.

For the 32-bit versions, you should issue the following commands in a command window in this order:

 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 CLEAN

 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL LIB_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL LIB_RELEASE_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL DLL_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 NULL DLL_RELEASE_UNICODE

 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 MOVE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100 CLEAN

The resulting libraries will be placed in the correct vc10_lib and vc10_dll directories under
the "lib" directory.

For the 64-bit versions, you should issue the following commands in a command window in this order:

 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100_64 CLEAN

 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100_64 NULL LIB_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100_64 NULL LIB_RELEASE_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100_64 NULL DLL_DEBUG_UNICODE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100_64 NULL DLL_RELEASE_UNICODE

 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100_64 MOVE
 wxBuild_wxWidgets vc100_64 CLEAN

The resulting libraries will be placed in the correct vc10_lib and vc10_dll directories under
the "lib64" directory.

The PasswordSafe VS2010 projects expect the static libraries to be in the wxWidgets sub-directories
\lib\vc_lib and \lib64\vc_lib for the 32-bit and 64-bit compilations respectively.

If you continue to use VS2005, you should put the static libraries built by it in \lib\vc8_lib.

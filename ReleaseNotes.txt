Password Safe 2.12 Release Note - June 2005
===========================================

This note describe the new features, fixed bugs and known problems
with Password Safe version 2.12. For a short description of Password
Safe, please see the accompanying README.txt file. For more
information on the product and the project, please visit
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net. Details about changes to previous
releases may be found in the file ChangeLog.txt.

This is a maintenance release, adding a couple of features, and fixing
some minor bugs.


4. I have re-organised the Help structure.
   a.  Moved all Help files to a sub-directory (called help) rather than
have the .hhp etc. file in the root.
   b. Changed many options in the .hhp file.
   c. Provided batch scripts to "correct" the Help HTML files ('tidy' from
http://www.w3c.org/).
   d. Provided batch scripts to change the Help HTML files and the hhp
file
to use either the "smaller lower resolution" gif files or the "larger
higher
resolution" jpg files (using perl).  Note: difference in chm file sizes is
only 84KB - so why bother have the gif files?
   e. Corrected some spelling errors in the HTML help files.
   f. Made sure that all the images correspond to the latest version.
   g. Moved "Help related" images to the images sub-directory of the new
help directory.  This leaves very few in the original images directory.
   h. Deleted files "Capture11-4-2004-10.26.20 AM11-5-2004-2.42.28
PM11-22-2004-6.56.40 PM.jpg" and "sad.jpg" from the original images
directory - not used!

You will then need to delete the original root 'help' and 'images'
directories and the following files from the root:
   msgs, pwsafe.chm, pwsafe.hhc, pwsafe.hhk,  pwsafe.hhp

I attached a zip file (extension .xyz)....

This contains:  the modified source, the new root 'help' directory (you may
want to delete the Perl files - perl.exe & perl58.dll and the tidy program -
tidy.exe) and the replacement root 'images' directory.

Note: the new images file_menu1 & file_menu2 (gif and jpg) replace the
file_menu images, which can be deleted. 

Noticed some problems with the help file (no popups!).

Now fixed - the entry for the popups script file must be:
    <script language="JavaScript" src="html/popups.js"></script>

and not:
    <script language="JavaScript" src="html/popups.js" 
type="text/JavaScript"></script>

Please see attached (which fixed a couple of other problemettes) - it is 
only for the root help directory and its sub-directories (html & images).

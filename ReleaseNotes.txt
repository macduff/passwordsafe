New Features for 2.09:
======================

[1074014] Silly message no longer displayed upon drag&drop of a file
onto main window.

New Features for 2.08:
======================
[1094005,1083950] Multiple instances of PasswordSafe can now open the same
database - only the first instance will be able to modify the database,
unles explicitly opened read-only.

Bugs fixed in 2.07:
===================
[1043438] Idle time lockout now works for idle times other than one
minute.
[1060241] Changing preference with no database opened no longer pops
up error message.
[1006234] Choosing "Cancel" in the Enter Password dialog box now exits
the application.
[1065049] Fixed broken link to Blowfish algorithm reference in Help.
[1021879] Enter on a tree-item expands/collapses the list under that
item.
[1055968,1030060] Import text now handles Notes that are more than one
line long (as long as the entire note is "within double quotes").

New Features for 2.07:
======================
[885984,722646] It is now possible to merge two different databases (File->Merge)
[1055961, 1030775, 947841] The action taken upon double-clicking an
entry can now be configured (via Manage->Misc): Either copy the
password to the clipboard or edit/view the entry.
[] The Import from text function is now more flexible: the field
separator can be configured, and the imported entries may be under a
common group or not.
[] It is now possible to import text files exported by KeePass.
[] The English online help file has been rewritten.

Known Problems:
===============
[879400] A category cannot be dragged to the top level. Workaround:
Edit the Group field of the categories entries. For example, to make
category "b" a top level category instead of under "a", change all
its entries Group fields from "a.b" to "b".

This is a maintenance release, adding a couple of minor features,
fixing a couple of bugs.

Bugs fixed in 2.04:
===================
[970036] 24 bit displays now display toolbar correctly
[971114] Switch to list view now works with new toolbar (silly typo in
2.03)
[972460] Master password is no longer kept in memory in the clear
[899400, 899414] Drag & drop is now accurate
[864828] Icon should now be visible in taskbar on all versions of
Windows and all color schemes.
[992073] Double clicking a group icon now does the right thing, i.e.,
nothing
[899412] Editing group names is now easier: Can now be invoked via F2
and right-click, finished by Enter, and cancelled by Escape.
[871471] Key shortcuts for Yes/No added to several dialog boxes.
[986874] "Ooops" message no longer appears upon invoking Browse to URL
[unreported] PasswordSafe now compiles cleanly under Visual Studio
.NET as well a Visual Studio 6.0

New Features for 2.04:
======================
[851563, 654677] Minimize to System Tray now supported. This is a configurable
feature, active by default. Clearing the checkbox in
Manage->Options->Display will restore the old behaviour.
[986345] The popup menu for entries now displays the more frequently
used operations (copy username & password) first.
[unreported] There's a new "lock on workstation lock" option in
Manage->Options->Security
[969038] Autotype feature added: This is a really nice feature that
pastes the selected entry's information (by default, username, tab,
password, tab, enter) to the current browser field. See the online
help for more details (See Autotype under "PasswordSafe Overview").
[978070] Search (Find) function is now better documented.

Bugs fixed in 2.03:
===================
[940585] On Windows XP, the toolbar would sometimes be invisible with
the tree view active.
[957957, 900331] No longer crashes when deleting certain items in tree view.

New Features for 2.03:
======================
[847769] An "installer" version is now available! Thanks to David Lacy
Kusters and Andrew Mill.
[912799, 947146] If the display supports more than 256 colors, the user can choose
between two styles of toolbar icons via the View menu. If not, then
only the simple toolbar is enabled.
[940000] The Notes section now has a scrollbar, making it easier to
view long notes entries.

Known Problems:
===============
[879400] A category cannot be dragged to the top level. Workaround:
Edit the Group field of the categories entries. For example, to make
category "b" a top level category instead of under "a", change all
its entries Group fields from "a.b" to "b".
[unreported] If the Tray Icon feature is enabled, the icon will not
reappear if Explorer crashes and restarts (you have to exit PWSafe, or
use TaskManager to terminate the process, and restart PWSafe to get
the tray icon back).
[unreported] Some of the menuitems in the Edit menu are relevant only
when an entry is selecte, or only when the tree view is active. They
should be greyed-out or removed when irrelevant (currently, they just
do nothing).

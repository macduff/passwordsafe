; 
; SYNOPSIS
;
; This script will create a self-extracting installer for the Password
; safe program.  It is intended to be used with the Nullsoft 
; Installation System, available at http://nsis.sf.net.   After use, 
; pwsafe-X.XX.exe will be placed in the current directory (where X.XX
; is the version number of Password Safe).  The generated file can be 
; placed on a publicly available location.
;
; DESCRIPTION
;
; This script will create a self-extracting installer for the Password
; Safe program.  Password Safe was designed to be self contained.
; In general, use of this installer is not mandatory. pwsafe.exe, the
; executable for Password Safe, can be placed in any location and run
; without any registration of DLLs, creation of directories, or entry
; of registry values.  When Password Safe intializes, any necessary
; setup will be performed by pwsafe.exe.  So, what is the purpose of
; this installer?
;
; This installer puts a familiar face on the installation process.
; Most Windows users are used to running a program to install 
; software, not copying a file or unzipping an archive.  Also, this
; installer performs some minor tasks that are common to many 
; Windows installers:
; 
; 1. The installer will allow the user to place icons on the desktop
;    or in the Start Menu, for easy access.  
;
; 2. The installer places two registry values in 
;    HKCU\Software\Password Safe\Password Safe.  These registry
;    values are for the use of the installer itself.  Password Safe
;    does not rely on these registry values.  If the installer is not
;    used, these registry values need not be created.
;
; 3. The installer will create an uninstaller and place an entry to
;    uninstall Password Safe in the Add or Remove Programs Wizard.
;
; As of PasswordSafe 3.05, this script allows users to choose
; between a "Regular" installation and a "Green" one, the difference
; being that the latter does not write app-specific data to the registry
; This is useful for installing to disk-on-key, and where company policy
; and/or user permissions disallow writing to the registry. Also, Green
; installation doesn't create an Uninstall.exe or entry in Add/Remove
; Software in the control panel - to unistall, just delete the install
; directory...
;
; USE
;
; To use this script, the following requirements must be satisfied:
;
; 1. Install NSIS (available at http://nsis.sf.net).  At least version
;    2.0 should be used.  This script is compatible with version 2.0
;    of NSIS.
;
; 2. Make sure that makensis.exe is on your path.  This is only to make
;    easier step 3 of the creation process detailed below.  This script
;    does not recursively call makensis.exe, so this step is merely for
;    convenience sake.
;
; After the above requirements are fulfilled, the following steps 
; should be followed each time you want to create a release:
;
; 1. Compile Password Safe in release mode.  The script relies on 
;    pwsafe.exe existing in the Release subdirectory.
;
; 2. Compile the help files for Password Safe.  The script relies on 
;    pwsafe.chm existing in the help/default subdirectory.
;
; 3. At the command line (or in a build script such as the .dsp file,
;    makefile, or other scripted build process), execute the following:
;
;        makensis.exe /DVERSION=X.XX pwsafe.nsi
;
;    where X.XX is the version number of the current build of Password
;    Safe.
;
; The output from the above process should be pwsafe-X.XX.exe.  This is
; the installer.  It can be placed, by itself, on a publicly available
; location.
; 
; the script is setup for 2 languages now (English + German)
; It's prepared for using Swedish and Spanish. Remove the comments ";-L-"
; supplementary languages can be easily brought in
; following "peaces" have to be provided
; - all language specific "Langstring", done in file "pwsafe.lng"
; - several MUI_LANGUAGE
; - several "File" for the language specific DLL
; - "Delete ...DLL" for each language (at install time)
; - 'Delete "$INSTDIR\pwsafeDE.dll"'  for each language (at uninstall time)
; - "Push" in the "Language selection dialog"

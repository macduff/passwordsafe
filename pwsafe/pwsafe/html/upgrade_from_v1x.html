		<h2>Upgrading Password Safe 1.x</h2>
		In order to accommodate enhanced features in the Password Safe program, there were structural changes that needed to be made to the Password Safe database and require conversion of databases between different Password Safe major versions (1.x and 2.x).

		<div class=instr>

			<h3>Upgrading Password Safe 1.x</h3>
			<p>Upgrading <b>Password Safe</b>  version 1.x  to 2.x merely consists of  opening the database with the newly installed version. The conversion takes place on the fly and a backup copy of the version 1.x file is created the first time the coverted databases is saved.</p>

			<h3>Rolling Back Version 2.x *.DAT files to Version 1.x</h3>
			<p>Use the backup file created by Password Safe during the upgrade or convert your current database to the 1.x format (<b>File > Export To</b> and select <b>Old (1.x) format...)</b> .</p>

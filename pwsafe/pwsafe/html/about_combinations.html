		<h2>A Word about Master Passwords</h2>
		<p>One of the most important keys to maintaining your security is selecting a strong master password   for your <b>Password Safe</b> database. The database or "Safe" contains all your user names, passwords, and any additional annotations you may have added. Picking a spouse's name, a birthday, or some other easily guessable combination leaves your  data vulnerable. While this may seem a bit like an oxymoron, it isn't: <i>It is important that you pick a hard-to-guess master password that <u>you can easily remember</u></i>.</p>

		<p><b>Password Safe</b> has a built in check for what it considers to be weak master passwords. In general, a master password (like any password) should consist of mixed case characters with at least one number or <a href=JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(strSpecialChars,popFont,9,9,-1,-1)>special character</a> (such as those found above the number keys on a keyboard). If a master password is entered that the program considers weak, it will prompt for verification. The user then has the option to accept the originally entered combination or to enter a new one.</p>

		<small><b>Note:&nbsp;There is no mechanism within the product to retrieve lost or forgotten safe passwords</b>. <br>Any mechanism for retrieving lost passwords poses a security hole that can be exploited.</small>

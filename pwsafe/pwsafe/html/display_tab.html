<h2>Display Tab</h2>




		<img style="width: 370px; height: 381px;" alt="Display Tab" src="images%5Cdisplay_tab.jpg">
		
<p>Functions within the <b>Display Tab</b> control how&nbsp;Password Safe and password items are displayed. </p>





		
<div class="instr">
			
<h3>Always keep Password Safe on top</h3>




			
<p>If checked, maximized <b>Password Safe</b> will always be the top most window displayed in the montior, regardless of what other window may have focus.</p>





			
<h3>Show password in display list &amp; tree</h3>




			
<p>If checked, passwords will be displayed in a column next to their associated user name when viewed in <b>Flattened List Mode</b>, or in square brackets following the user's name in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nested Tree Mode</span> view.<br>




			<i><small>This option is <span style="font-weight: bold;">strongly</span> discouraged in environments where passers-by can view the montior.</small></i></p>





			
<h3>Show password&nbsp;in add &amp; edit mode</h3>




			
<p>If checked, passwords that would&nbsp;be hidden in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Entry and</span> <b>Edit/View Entry</b> dialogs will be displayed in plain text. You can display the passwords by clicking on the "Show" button in the dialog.</p>





			
<h3>Show notes in edit</h3>
If checked, notes will be displayed by default in edit dialog. If not,
you will need to click on the Notes field in order to view the text
there. <br>
<h3>Initial tree view</h3>
This determines how your entries will be displayed in the tree view when you open the database.
<h3>Put icon in System Tray</h3>




			
<p>If checked, <b>Password Safe</b> will minimize to the the System Tray area. If unchecked, the program will minimize to the task bar.</p>

<p>The icon in the system tray indicates whether the password database is locked (<img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="locked" src="images/locked_tray.gif">) or unlocked (<img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="unlocked" src="images/unlocked_tray.gif">). If it is locked, you will be prompted for the master combination when you try to unminimize it.</p>


<h3>Remember last used entries in System Tray menu</h3>


If the "Put icon in System Tray" option is enabled, you can right-clisk
on the system tray icon to get to the most recently used entries
directly, without going through the application's main screen. This
option allows you to configure how many recent entries you wish to keep.
<h3>Number of Recent Entries kept in history</h3>



If the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Put Icon in System Tray </span>option is enabled, right-clicking on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe </span>icon in the System Tray will open a menu that will allow you to rapidly access the last entries you've used since starting up <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span>. Here you can configure how many entries to save, up to a maximum of 25.
			
<h3>Recent Passwordsafe Databases</h3>




			
<p>These controls allow you to configure how many
		recently opened databases are displayed in the File menu,
		for easy access. Note that you need to exit and restart
		<b>Password Safe</b> for changes in this control to take effect.</p>


<h3>Recent Databases on File Menu rather than as a sub-menu</h3>


This option determines how the recently opened databases are presented
in the File menu - directly on the menu, or as a sub-menu.

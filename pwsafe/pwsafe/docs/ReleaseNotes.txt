[2832983] The Edit/View dialog now shows the details of the entry
being edited/viewed in its title caption (This is updated when saving
the entry).
[2832810] A new email field has been added, supporting email headers
'to', 'subject', 'cc', 'bcc' and 'body' (per RFC 2368 - see online
help for details). If this field is not empty, it is used instead of
the URL field even if that contains an email address.
Note: whereas the URL field had to have the 'mailto:' prefix to denote an 
email address rather than a URL, the email field must not contain this prefix.
[] PasswordSafe now handles Vista (and later) logoff, shutdown &
restart more gracefully, giving the user now has more time to save a
modified database.
[] Add new AutoType special fields '\wnnn' and '\Wnnn'. Unlike '\d', which
sets the delay between sending each subsequent character, '\w' & '\W'
introduces a one-time delay where they appear.  For '\w', the value 'nnn' is in
milli-seconds. For '\W', this specifies seconds. Note: Max. value is
999s (16m 39s), during which time PasswordSafe will be unresponsive
while it waits the specified time. Also supported via the Run Command
$a command.
[] Add menu item to copy the Run Command to the clipboard.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.19
====================================
[] Changing the Security option to lock Password Safe when the workstation is
locked, no longer requires a restart of Password Safe to come into effect.
[] Due to the French keyboard not supporting the key '-' in an accelerator,
the shortcut for "Password Subset" has been changed from "Ctrl + -" to
"Ctrl + B". Please do not allocate "Ctrl + -" to any shortcut if you will be
using a French keyboard.
[] If a dialog is open (e.g. Add, Edit, Options etc.) and Password Safe is
minimized, the Close and Exit options are no longer in the System Tray context
menu. The user must first Restore the application and close the dialog before
being able to close the database or exit the program.
[] If preferences stored in the database are changed, the user will be asked if
they want to save them in the database when closing the database or application
even if none of the entries have been changed.
[] The preference to Lock the Database after a certain amount of idle time has
changed from being a global parameter affecting all databases opened by the user
to be specific to each database.

dots between successive group names.
[2450827] Add a new menu item (on Edit Menu or right-click context
menu) to go to the corresponding base entry of an Alias or Shortcut. As

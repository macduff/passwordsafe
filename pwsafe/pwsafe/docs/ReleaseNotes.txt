Password Safe 3.12 Release Notes - January 2008
===============================================

This note describe the new features, fixed bugs and known problems
with Password Safe version 3.12. For a short description of Password
Safe, please see the accompanying README.txt file. For more
information on the product and the project, please visit
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net. Details about changes to previous
releases may be found in the file ChangeLog.txt.

Bugs fixed in 3.12
==================
[1849830] Help now works properly for Manage->Option, displaying the
relevant topic.
[1849818] Browse-to would occasionally falsely report "failed to
browse to URL".
[1843631] "Browse to Icon" now correctly shown using new Toolbar.
[1841525] Increasing the number of passwords saved no longer deletes the
existing Password History.
[1670193] Allow use of Windows Common Controls V6 with Vista.
[] Pressing a character in the List view will now jump to the next entry
with text beginning with that character in the second column. This
is a change from previous behaviour which only looked in the first column,
now occupied by the icon.  This now follows MS's approach that if characters
are typed fast enough (within 1 second), it will treat them as a string
i.e. 'a' followed by 'b' will look for entry starting 'ab' etc.
[] Allow Expand/Collapse for R/O databases via toolbar.
[] Set focus to new view on switching between Tree <-> List views.
[] Update toolbar when view changes (List <-> Tree)
[] Set PWS title when opening a database at startup
[] Allow List view to process all characters e.g. Page Up/Down, Home, End,
Arrows etc.
[] Fix program crash on clicking CompareResults dialog header.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.12
====================================
[1846688] When generating a new password, it is no longer displayed in
a separate window for approval. If you want to generate another
password, just click on Generate again. If you want to revert to the
existing password when editing an entry, just click on Cancel.
[] New password generation option: Pronounceable passwords. Thanks to
Tom Van Vleck, Morrie Gasser, and Dan Edwards.
[] New disabled buttons for New Toolbar.

New Features for 3.12
=======================
[1842449] Implement standard F3 for repeat Find shortcut.
[] An entry may have multiple references, or "shortcuts" to it. These
may be thought of as "synonyms" of the entry. See online help for
details.
[] Graphics added to menus.

Bugs fixed in 3.11.1
====================
[1837534] Autotype handles tab correctly when typing to Internet
Explorer.

[] Give user access to Reports from View menu (only in the same directory
as current open database), since more information is being written there.
[] Give user access to the Compare report from the Compare results dialog.
[] New email action allowed in URL field. To be treated as email, the
data must be prefixed by the characters "mailto:". The data following
this corresponds to the '[mailto:]' standard RFC2368.
For example: "info@example.com?subject=PasswordSafe".
[] Main toolbar can be customized via MS's standard dialog via right
click on this toolbar.
[] Several entries may be "aliased" to a single entry, sharing its
password. See online help for details.

[1815192] The Find function has been re-implemented as a toolbar at
bottom of application.
Button shortcuts: Ctrl+Alt+A = Advanced find,
Ctrl+Alt+S = toggle case Sensitivity, Ctrl+Alt+C = Clear find text
[1790342] Replaced additional key shortcuts for ExpandAll and CollapseAll
[introduced in rev. 1678] by toolbar buttons.  Now there is only one set 
(the original) of key shortcuts + toolbar buttons.
[1756385] The color of the application's system tray icon (when the
application is started and when there's no open database) is now user
configurable, fixing a visibility problem under Vista.
[] Saved string preferences within the database header will not be delimited by 
a doublequote if this character is part of the string variable.  An arbitrary
symbol type character will be used in this case.  If one cannot be found, the
string preference will not be saved in the database.

Bugs fixed in 3.11
==================
[1806201] Non-unique uuids in database now handled correctly.
[1799523] Fix PWS taking a long time saving after XML Import into new DB by

have BOM as some text editors insist!
[] Disable Rename menu item in List View (only appropriate in Tree View).
[] Disable Tray Minimize/Restore menu items if already Minimized/Visible.
[] Ignore mouse right click not in Tree/List view area.
[] Use the Confirm Delete message even when there is only one child.

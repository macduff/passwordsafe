releases may be found in the file ChangeLog.txt.

New Features for 3.25.1
=======================
[3288341] Autotype now added to the DragBar. Drag the image to an input area
on another Window (e.g. Browser) and PasswordSafe will begin Autotype from there.
[3286721] User can now toggle the database between read-only and read-write
mode (and vice versa) via a menu item or by double-clicking on the current
R-O or R/W indicator in the StausBar.
[3203152] The language can changed 'on-the-fly'. It requires that the
resource-only DLLs be built with V2.0 or later of ResPWSL (i.e. supplied
with PasswordSafe V3.25.1 or later).
[3065111] Add/Edit now displays both the Application's (PasswordSafe) and the
current database's default Autotype string (if set via Manage->Options).
[2964804] The user can specify the list of symbols valid for a database and can
override this for any particular entry. Note: the inbuilt special symbols
for EasyVision and Pronounceable passwords can not be overriden in either case.
[] Allow user to control the copying password to clipboard when performing
"Browse to URL" via an option in Options->Security. This is a database option
i.e. you can have different setting for different databases.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.25.1
======================================
[] Polish installation texts added thanks to Michal Niklas.
[] An entry's password exipry date is set or cleared directly rather than using
the Set and Clear buttons after changing values.
[] The default password generation policy is now for 12 character
passwords that include symbol characters (previous default was 8, no
symbols).

Bugs fixed in 3.25.1
====================
[3234204] PasswordSafe no longer ends if the command flag is set to "-s <databasename>".
[] Controls in Edit are now disabled if entry is protected, even though the user could
not have saved any changes.

New Features for 3.25
=====================
[] Dutch installation instructions thank to Kees, and a first
(incomplete) Dutch translation of the application thank to Bert, Kees
and Fred.
[] Korean texts in the application and installer program thanks to
Seunggyun.
[] Poserpro has provided Traditional Chinese texts for the installer
program.
[] New View menu option: Show entries with Expiry. This is useful for
displaying entries with passwords that are expired or about to expire.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.25
====================================
[3171962] The password expiration warning mechanism now checks for
expiration daily. The display of expired and almost-expired entries
has been redesigned, allowing users to update the entry directly. When
an expired password is changed, the expiry date will be cleared unless
there is a recurring password expiry interval, in which case a new
expiry date will be calculated.
[3131945] Double-clicking on the system tray icon when PasswordSafe is
not minimized now brings it to front, instead of minimizing.
[3131935] Rename of an entry or group in the Tree View can now only be
performed via the Rename shortcut (default value F2), using the Edit
menu or the right-click context menu. Edit in place by double clicking
the entry is no longer allowed as, most of the time, this was not the
desired action.
[] Filtered views are now updated when an entry's edited, e.g., if an
entry is edited such that it no longer satisfies the filter's
criteria, it will be removed from the display. 
[] The Russian online help has been totally rewritten and updated,
thanks to pm_kan.
[] pm_kan has updated the Russian texts.
[] The Spanish texts have been updated thanks to Jose.
[] Karlo has updated the German texts.
[] Francois has updated the French texts.
[] Bjorne has updated the Swedish version.
[] Freedoctor has updated the Chinese texts.

Bugs fixed in 3.25
==================
[3194472] Fix new group creation location. When a Group is selected, then
selecting 'Add Group' from the Edit menu or from the context menu
displayed by right clicking on that Group, the new group will be a
child of the selected group. However, when using the context menu
displayed on right clicking on 'white space' below the last
entry/group displayed, the group will be created at the topmost
level. 
[3165889] No longer crashes if search starts with Shift-Enter (search
backwards).
[3148701] Windows installer will now refuse to install on Win2K,
referring user to last supported version on that OS (3.18).
[3115760] Window view is now saved and restored if the user uses the Windows
"Show Desktop" feature.
[] No longer crashes when doing an Undo after a Merge.
[] Ensure Undo/Redo honour the changes to the display of the original change.

<div class="instr"><br>
A "filter" is a criteria (or set of criteria) that an entry either matches or doesn't match. <span style="font-weight: bold;">PasswordSafe </span>allows
you to define filters, and display only those entries that matches a
given filter. You can define a filter for a one-time query, or you can
define several filters, name them and store them persistently, fo
repeated use. Filters may be either stored along with the database, or
externally, for sharing the same filter across several databases.<br>
<h2>Defining a Filter</h2>
To define a new filter, select the View-&gt;Filter-&gt;New/Edit Filter menu entry. The following dialog box will be displayed:<br>
<img style="width: 485px; height: 340px;" alt="Display Filter dialog box" src="images/filter.jpg"><br>
<br>
As you can see, each Filter consists of one or more <span style="font-weight: bold;">rows, </span>where each row defines a <span style="font-weight: bold;">criteria </span>on a given <span style="font-weight: bold;">field</span>.
The conditions defined in each row can be either "and" or "or" the
condition defined in the previous row. This allows you to define the
following kinds of filters:<br>
1.&nbsp;All entries with a username containing "joe" or "Joe" or "JOE":<br>
<img style="width: 471px; height: 67px;" alt="example1" src="images/filter-ex1.jpg"><br>
2. All entries with a username "Joe" (exactly) created after May 1st 2008<br>
<img style="width: 471px; height: 69px;" alt="example2" src="images/filter-ex2.jpg"><br>
3. All entries with a username containing "joe" or "mary"<br>
<img style="width: 474px; height: 70px;" alt="example3" src="images/filter-ex3.jpg"><br>
<br>
As you can see, the filters can be arbitrarily complex.<br>
<br>
The columns in the Filter table are are follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>'#' - This is the row number. It's displayed for convenience, and cannot be modified.</li>
  <li>'?' - The checkbox in this column determines if the row is <span style="font-weight: bold;">active </span>or not. Only active rows are used when applying the filter. Clicking on the checkbox enables/disables the row.</li>
  <li>'+' - Click on this to insert a new row below a given row.</li>
  <li>'-' - Click on this to delete the current row. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>Since deleting a row is permanent, you might wish to <span style="font-weight: bold;">disable </span>&nbsp;it instead.</li>
  <li>'And/Or' - This allows you to determine the relation of the rule you're adding to the previous rule.</li>
  <li>'Field' - Select the entry field you're interested in, e.g., username, title, group, notes, etc.</li>
  <li>'Criteria' - Define the value you're interested in for the selected field.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Applying a Filter</h2>
Once you've defined a filter, clicking on 'Apply' will apply the filter
on the entries in the database, while leaving the Set Filter dialog box
open. This is useful for fixing and refining the filter based on the
results. Clicking on 'OK' will also apply the filter, but will close
the Set Filter dialog box.

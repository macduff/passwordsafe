<h2>Importing Entries</h2>




		
		
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span> allows you to import password information from other
formats. These files may be generated by other applications, exported
from a spreadsheet, or even written by hand using Notepad or a similar
text editor.</p>


<p>The formats that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span> support are:</p>


<ul>


  <li><a href="#text">Text</a></li>


  <li><a href="#XML">XML</a></li>


  <li>KeePass (another password management utility)</li>


</ul>





		
<div class="instr">
			
<h3><a name="text"></a>Text Format</h3>


<p>Text files used to import password entries&nbsp;consist of one or
more password entries. Each field within an entry is separated by a
field separator and each entry may consist of one or more lines. The fields are as follows:</p>





			
<ul>




				<li><b>Group and Title Field</b><br>



Groups and Titles are separated by periods. For example
Finance.BangForBuckBank (Group.Title). If there is no associated group
(a top level entry), then the Title should contain no periods.</li>




				<li><b>User Field</b><br>



The name of the user associated with this entry. To use the default name specified in <b>Options...</b> this field should be blank.</li>





				<li><b>Password Field</b><br>



The actual password.</li>



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">URL</span><br>



The URL associated with this entry (if any)</li>



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">AutoType</span><br>



The AutoType string to be used instead of the default (see <a href="autotype.html">AutoType</a>)</li>



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creation Time</span><br>



The date and time that the entry was created, in the format of "YYYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS".</li>



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Modification Time</span><br>



The date and time that the password was last modified, in the same format as the creation time</li>



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Last Access Time</span><br>



The last date and time that the entry was accessed (username or password copied to clipboard or entry viewed)</li>



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Expiry Date</span><br>



The date and time that the entry was set to expire</li>



  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Record Modified Time</span><br>



The last time that any field in the entry was modified</li>




				
				<li><b>Notes Field</b><br>



If the Note is more than a single word, it must be enclosed between
double quotes ("test note"). A note may span more than a single line,
as long as it is terminated with a double quote.</li>




			
</ul>



	

			
<h3>Import Text Settings Dialog</h3>




			
<p>The field separator used in the text file being imported and a
default group name to import the new entries into can be configured before processing the file.</p>


<p><img style="width: 324px; height: 203px;" alt="Import Text Settings" src="images/import.jpg"></p>


<p> </p>



<ol>




				<li><b>File &gt; Import From....</b></li>




				<li>Select <b>Plain Text...</b></li>




				<li>Set import settings and parameters for the text file being imported</li>




				<li>If a Notes field multi-line delimiter character has been
used, either in a previous Export or using a text editor, enter it here
so that, during the Import process, the Notes field will be split into
multiple lines by replacing this character by a newline.</li>



  <li>If the text file has no date information, then the "Import V2 or earlier text file" should be checked.</li>




				<li>Click <b>OK</b></li>




				<li>Select the text file to import.</li>




			
</ol>




			
<hr>
			<small><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">IMPORTANT</span>: </b>The
first line of the file being imported must be a tab-separated list of
the names of the fields that each entry contains, e.g.,
"Group/Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Username&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Password&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; URL", etc. This line is generated
automatically by the "<a href="export.html">Export Text</a>" function, but must be added manually for files created from other tools.<br>
</small>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><small><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;At the end of the import process, a
small dialog box appears showing how may entries were added, and how
many (if any) were unsuccessfully parsed.<br>



</small>
			
<hr>
<h3><a name="XML"></a>XML</h3>


XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a popular format for transferring
data between applications. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span> can import XML files that were
generated according to the schema defined&nbsp; in the file <span style="font-style: italic;">pwsafe.xsd</span>,
which is provided as part of the distribution.&nbsp;

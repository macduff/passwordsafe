This is the second BETA release of version 2.0 of PasswordSafe. While
much effort has been put into assuring the stability of the program
and the integrity of the data, it cannot be considered "production
quality" yet, and therefore should not be used except for evaluating
the new features and providing input as to bugs, feature requests, etc.

=========================
[RFE 782508, 829563, 815350, 555440] Tree, or heirarchical, view of
entries now supported. This allows the user to define categories,
sub-categories, etc.

- Export to v1.7 format fixed.

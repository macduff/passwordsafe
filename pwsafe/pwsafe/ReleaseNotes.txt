will delete the installation directory if and only if it's empty.

(ASSERT failed in debug version - potential problem in release
version)
[1076377] Entering the wrong password 3 times no longer allows you to
create an empty database with the same name.
[1108115] "Cancel" at "Safe Combination Entry" no longer opens blank
database with name of existing database.

item.
[1055968,1030060] Import text now handles Notes that are more than one
line long (as long as the entire note is "within double quotes").

New Features for 2.07:
======================
[885984,722646] It is now possible to merge two different databases (File->Merge)
[1055961, 1030775, 947841] The action taken upon double-clicking an
entry can now be configured (via Manage->Misc): Either copy the
password to the clipboard or edit/view the entry.
[] The Import from text function is now more flexible: the field
separator can be configured, and the imported entries may be under a
common group or not.
[] It is now possible to import text files exported by KeePass.
[] The English online help file has been rewritten.

Known Problems:
===============
[879400] A category cannot be dragged to the top level. Workaround:
Edit the Group field of the categories entries. For example, to make
category "b" a top level category instead of under "a", change all
its entries Group fields from "a.b" to "b".

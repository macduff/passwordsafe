with Password Safe version 1.92. For a short description of Password

New Features for 1.92:
======================
[736391] Whan a new master passphrase ("Safe Combination") is defined, the
user is warned if it is cryptographically weak.

[732609] The Options dialog box has been tabified, hopefully making it
less intimidating for non-technical users.

[505540] It is now possible to change the default length of generated
passwords.

[541928] It is now possible to specify the "Password Policy" via the
Options dialog box, i.e., only uppercase, with/without digits, etc.

Features added in 1.91:
=======================
[728507] Password Safe now remembers the last ten databases that were
opened, and displays them in the File drop-down menu.

[726583] Password Safe can now be set to be "always on top" via
options or system menu.

[726482] Password Safe now accepts the name of a database as an
optional command line arugement, opening the database instead of the
last one opened.

[726481] Title, username, notes and optionally the passwords (strongly
discouraged), are now displayed in the main window as separate
columns. It is possible to sort by a column by double-clicking the
column's name. Double-clicking the same column again will reverse the
order of the sort.

[726476] It is now possible to resize the main window. Password Safe
will remember the size and location of the last invocation.

have been replaced by something more clearly distinguishable.

closed while minimized.

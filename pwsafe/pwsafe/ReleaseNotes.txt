Password Safe 1.92c Release Note - August 2003
==============================================

This note describe the new features, fixed bugs and known problems
with Password Safe version 1.92c. For a short description of Password
Safe, please see the accompanying README.txt file. For more
information on the product and the project, please visit
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net

1.92c:
======
Release 1.92c is a maintenance release, fixing some minor issues:

Bugfix [783314] Clearing the clipboard now properly trashes the
password in process memory, as well as emptying the clipboard.

Bugfix [760656] Passing a filename that contains spaces via the
command line now works correctly. Previously, the quotation marks
confused PasswordSafe.

Bugfix [777367] The Edit/View Item dialog box's Help button now works
correctly.

RFE [772212] Pressing Cancel when prompted for the password when
unminimizing the application no longer exits the program. (Would
happen only if "Lock password database on minimize" is set)

Bugfix [769820] Pressing Cancel in the Clear Clipboard dialog box will
now prevent the passowrd from being copied to the clipboard.
Previously, it was equivalent to pressing OK. (Would happen
only if "Confirm item copy to clipboard" was selected)

RFE [768870] Added a manifest file for native Windows XP theme
support.

RFE [754790] The option "Clear the clipboard when minimized" has been
changed to "Clear clipboard upon minimize or exit". Previously, the
clipboard was unconditionally cleared upon exit. This allows the user
to change the behaviour.

1.92b:
======
Release 1.92b is a maintenance release, fixing a minor, but annoying, problem:

Bugfix [746127] When starting PasswordSafe, the focus was not set to
the first list entry (it appears in blue, but the dotted line is not
on it). You need to press the down-button first. The bad thing about
this is, that you can't type the first letter of the entry you want to
jump to.

1.92a:
======
Release 1.92a is a maintenance release that addresses the following
two issues. If you didn't notice these bugs, then there's no reason to
upgrade.

Bugfix [738380]: Show Passwords in list wasn't kept correctly across
application invokations. Selecting this option and exiting the
application would cause the passwords no to be shown when the
application was next run.

Support request [736497] & Bugfix [589536]: It is now possible to read
passwordsafe databases on multilingual systems, specifically Chinese XP.

New Features for 1.92:
======================
[736391] Whan a new master passphrase ("Safe Combination") is defined, the
user is warned if it is cryptographically weak.

[732609] The Options dialog box has been tabified, hopefully making it
less intimidating for non-technical users.

[505540] It is now possible to change the default length of generated
passwords.

[541928] It is now possible to specify the "Password Policy" via the
Options dialog box, i.e., only uppercase, with/without digits, etc.

Features added in 1.91:
=======================
[728507] Password Safe now remembers the last ten databases that were
opened, and displays them in the File drop-down menu.

[726583] Password Safe can now be set to be "always on top" via
options or system menu.

[726482] Password Safe now accepts the name of a database as an
optional command line arugement, opening the database instead of the
last one opened.

[726481] Title, username, notes and optionally the passwords (strongly
discouraged), are now displayed in the main window as separate
columns. It is possible to sort by a column by double-clicking the
column's name. Double-clicking the same column again will reverse the
order of the sort.

[726476] It is now possible to resize the main window. Password Safe
will remember the size and location of the last invocation.

[639439] Searching the database for a given text is now supported. All
fields except the password are scanned, case insensitive by
default. Invoke by Edit->Find Entry or via Ctrl-F.

[635048] The taskbar icons for "copy password" and "copy username"
have been replaced by something more clearly distinguishable. 

Bugs Fixed in 1.92:
===================
[733361] The application is no longer "permanently minimized" if
closed while minimized.

[556365] Generated passwords now include 'z', 'Z', and '9'. The
distribution of numbers and letters has also been corrected.

Bugs Fixed in 1.91:
===================
[731709] "File open error Can't open database xxxxx.dat" is no longer
displayed on the first run of a fresh install.

[730661] Toolbar buttons would disappear under some circumstances.

[591882] It is now possible to copy via Ctrl-C from the Title,
Username and Notes fields in the Edit/View Entry window.

[730640] Password changes not saved in Edit dialog when "show password
by default" option enabled.

Known Problems:
===============
- The Help file is outdated for this release.

This is a v0.2 release, so there is much to do in every way ;-)

* Options are persisted to file, but aren't yet wired to any GUI functionality (except for generate password)
* The MRU only refreshes on each restart
* The right click menus aren't context sensitive
* The lauching of URLs in comments fields (Ctrl-T) is not yet implemented
* None of the help is implemented (how to do this in crossplatform manner...)
* Status bar is there, but not used for anything
* Incorporate version info into about box or somewhere
* Icons in toolbar are grungy and need more photoshop-ing
* Logging is should be configured at INFO so all the DEBUG stuff doesn't go out
* Starting planning for I18N


Platform Specific Stuff

MacOSX
* Launching website doesn't work. Need to update browser code.
* Integrate preferences in the Appname menu rather than on "Manage" menu
* MRUs go in a particular Recent menu
* Need ant task to build dmg file (currently by hand)
* "Warning"/"Info" icons on dialogs is pretty bizarre and non-native
* Verbs should be used for buttons names "Save", "Don't Save" instead of windows "Yes"/"No"

Linux/Unix
* Launcher script is pretty dodgy. Need help from a shell dude (or someone who knows about desktop integration on Linux)
* Do we need builds for Motif environments?
* Do we need a Solaris bundle?


Win32
* Should move off Glen's copy of exe4j into OSS alternative (JSmooth looks good but lacks Ant task)

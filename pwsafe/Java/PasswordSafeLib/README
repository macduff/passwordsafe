PasswordSafeLib
===============

This is a Java implementation of the core functionality of PasswordSafe.  For
the moment it should be considered early-access software.  It should be
stable enough for you to start developing against as long as you are aware
that:

1.  Without doubt there are plenty of bugs waiting to be found.

2.  The package structure may change.  I don't anticipate making any changes,
    but as I add features I find bits that I'm unhappy with and refactor
    them.

3.  You should't use it with any real passwordsafe files that you can't
    recover should this software do horrible things to them.

4.  Writing files has not been tested thouroughly, in fact it's hardly been
    tested at all so use at your own risk.  I don't know whether it's
    possible to create a new file from scratch yet.

5.  This is the most insecure version of password safe there is.  When a
    file is read it is stored in memory in plain text format.  And so is the
    file's password.  I hope to rectify this sometime but not in the immediate
    future.  I'm actually not sure whether anything I do is going to be
    effective since I have practically no control over object creation,
    deletion, garbage collection, cloning, etc.

6.  The areas of the API that deal with modifying and creating files are
    volatile and are likely to change.  You'll almost certainly need to
    rewrite bits of your code if you use tham as they stand right now.

7.  The Javadocs are far from complete and might be wildly inaccurate in
    places.

With all that said I hope that this library is of use and welcome any feedback
you have through the normal passwordsafe developer lists.

What you need:

1.  A Java JDK.  This was developed with 1.4.2 but it might work with 1.3

2.  The BlowfishJ package, available from http://www.come.to/hahn.  Version
    2.13 was used to develop this, other versions may have issues.  However,
    before you can build you need to apply the patch SHA1.java.diff against
    SHA1.java.  This fixes an issue that arises because the c++ version uses
    SHA1 in a non-standard way.

3.  log4j - http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/

4.  JUnit - http://www.junit.org/

5.  The C++ version of PasswordSafe (both 1.9.2c and 2.0) to create/edit
    Password Safes.

If you use the Eclipse IDE for development you can use the .project and
.classpath files to import the project into your workspace, although you'll
need to change the paths in .classpath to match the locations on your system.

Bugs fixed in 3.22.1
====================
[3016803] No longer crashes when trying to view a base entry with
similarly named aliases.
[3013199] PasswordSafe no longer hangs when trying to read preferences
stored in registry by older versions.
[3011972] By adding more checking when creating the menus for Recent Entries
off the System Tray menu, prevent crashing when clicking on the icon. 
[3010541, 3013981, 3011972] Fixed crash when locked and the user
right-clicks the System Tray icon.
[3009130] Changes to an entry's password policy are now saved upon OK or Apply.
[3008203] The password expiration date is now automatically updated when
a "recurring" password expiration is set and the password is changed.
[3006125] Selected entry/group before database is locked or minimized,
including when Windows goes into Standby/Hibernate is now re-selected when
the database is later displayed.
[3006069] Autotype now works correctly when the user specifies that
PasswordSafe should minimize after Autotype and has also set that the
database should be locked on minimize.
[2957038] Cursor no longer disappears when PasswordSafe thinks that the
user is dragging an entry but then doesn't.
[] The Save Toolbar button and the Save menu item are now correctly
enabled if the user changes preferences saved in the database.

New Features for 3.22
=====================
[] Support for Danish has been added - thanks to Rejmond for his
effort in translating!
[2983775] Recently Used Entries are now saved in the database header and
so are "persistent".  The current Windows user interface limits this to a
maximum of the last 25 entries accessed.

the results of a Compare database operation.
[] Validation of databases can now be performed via the Manage menu as
well as via the command line flag '-v'. When executed via the menu, it
is very similar to opening a new database in that the current open database
is closed and the selected database is validated during the open process.
[] Allow user to select external editor for Notes field in Add/Edit dialog.
[] Add entry size to the available filters to be able view entries.
[] Warn users during database open and entry import if there are entries
with large text fields (e.g. Notes) that cannot be fully displayed and may
be truncated if edited.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.22

Windows. Existing installations will use current preferences, but
users can migrate to the new location via
Manage->Options->System->Migrate PasswordSafe configuration to user
directory.
[] New databases will be created by default in "My Safes" directory
under "My Documents".

Bugs fixed in 3.22

and OK buttons.

(UUID elements).

intermediate changes can be saved without closing the Edit property pages.

successfully found the first time.
[] Undo/Redo of changes to the currently open database. Any change to
the database can now be undone and redone, as long as the database is
open. This is similar to the undo/redo feature available in most word
processors, and is activated the same way (Ctrl-Z for undo, Ctrl-Y for
redo, or via the Edit menu).
[] New Synchronize feature (subset of the current Merge function) to
allow changes in the fields of entries of two databases to be
synchronised.  Entries with identical Group names, Titles and User
names are compared when syncing. The database selected to be
synchronised with the current open database is now always in read-only
mode i.e. Synchronisation is uni-directional and only entries in the
currently open database can be modified.

opened in read-only mode.

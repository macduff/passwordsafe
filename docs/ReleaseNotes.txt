New Features for 3.26

input area on another Window (e.g., Browser) and PasswordSafe will
begin Autotype from there. 
[3286721] User can now toggle between read-only and read-write modes
via a menu item or by double-clicking on the current R-O or R/W
indicator in the Status Bar.
[3203152] The displayed language can now be changed via the new
Manage->Change Language menu.
[3065111] Add/Edit now displays both the Application's (PasswordSafe) and the
current database's default Autotype string (if set via Manage->Options).
[2964804, 1855389] The user can specify the list of symbols valid for
password generation, and can override this for any particular
entry (except when EasyVision or Pronounceable passwords are chosen).
[1831893, 1471134] Added Autotype code "\s" to send "Shift+Tab" (back tab).
[] Allow user to control copying of the password to clipboard when
performing "Browse to URL" via an option in Options->Security. This is
a database option i.e., you can have different setting for different
databases.
[] Support importing of TXT, CSV files and XML exported from KeePass
V1 and KeePass V2 XML files. Note that KeePass V2's export in the V1
format is does not conform to their own format as specified by their
V1 product and can not be imported. Please review our Help file for
the settings in KeePass required during their export. 

Changes to Existing Features in 3.26
====================================
[] New image on start-up dialog - courtesy of user Prinz_Eugen.
[] Polish installation texts added thanks to Michal Niklas.
[] An entry's password expiry date is set or cleared directly rather than using
the Set and Clear buttons after changing values.
[] The default password generation policy is now for 12 character
passwords that include symbol characters (previous default was 8, no
symbols).
[] Unknown database header fields and unknown entry fields are no
longer exported when a database is exported to XML as there is no
mechanism to re-check them during import. Exporting to XML and then
importing to a new database can be used to remove these unknown
fields.
[] Date time fields, when exported to XML, now are in the W3C dateTime
standard format instead of PasswordSafe's.  This release can import
XML files with date time fields in either of these forms. The next
release will only be able to process the W3C standard.
[] Fully support importing of TXT files exported from KeePass V1
including the Group Tree structure, URL and date time fields. Please
review the online help for more details.

icon's Recent Entry menu if the display has not been restored after
minimize or unlock.

the database is read-only.
[3303018] Filters with quotes in their name are now correctly
exported, imported and displayed in the Manage Filters dialog.
[3301904] Export XML, export Text and the export of filters functions

displaying entries with passwords that are expired or about to expire.

Changes to Existing Features in 3.25
====================================
[3171962] The password expiration warning mechanism now checks for
expiration daily. The display of expired and almost-expired entries
has been redesigned, allowing users to update the entry directly. When
an expired password is changed, the expiry date will be cleared unless
there is a recurring password expiry interval, in which case a new
expiry date will be calculated.

not minimized now brings it to front, instead of minimizing.

desired action.

entry is edited such that it no longer satisfies the filter's

Bugs fixed in 3.25
==================
[3194472] Fix new group creation location. When a Group is selected, then
selecting 'Add Group' from the Edit menu or from the context menu
displayed by right clicking on that Group, the new group will be a
child of the selected group. However, when using the context menu
displayed on right clicking on 'white space' below the last
entry/group displayed, the group will be created at the topmost
level. 
[3165889] No longer crashes if search starts with Shift-Enter (search
backwards).

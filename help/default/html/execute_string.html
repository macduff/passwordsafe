<h2>Execute String</h2>

<p>This field contains a command that Password Safe will execute when so instructed. It is
equivalent to typing this into a DOS or CMD box or, if it just specifies a file
name, double clicking the file in Windows Explorer.</p>

<p>However, Password Safe is able to substitute values associated with this database and this
particular entry before actually executing it. These values replace 'variables'
in this command string. Variable names broadly follow the Perl and other
scripting rules as detailed below:</p>

<p>The 'Execute String' is parsed using the dollar ('$') as indicating the
start of a variable. NO recursive substitution is performed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Variables are specified as '$name' and <i>are case sensitive</i>. The name must start with an
alphabetic character and the remaining characters must be alphanumeric. The variable name is 
terminated either by encountering a non-alphanumeric character or the end of the Execute String.</li>
<ul>
<li>To use a variable followed by an alphanumeric character in the Execute String, enclose it in
curly brackets e.g.<br>
'${name}string'.</li>

<li>To use a '$' in the
string as normal text and not indicating that the following text is a variable
name, escape it using a back-slash ('\') e.g. '\$text' becomes '$text' and is
not treated as a variable called 'text'.</li>

<li>To use a back-slash before a '$' as a back-slash, escape it with a back-slash e.g. '\\$name'
becomes '\$name' in the resulting text and '$name' is treated as a variable. A
back-slash does not have to be escaped unless it precedes a '$' indicating a
following variable.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<li>Valid formats are:</li>

<ul>
<li>$axxxx*..........</li>

<li>${axxxx}.........</li>

<li>$axxxx[n]........</li>

<li>${axxxx[n]}......

<br>
where the following describes the permitted characters:</li>

<ul>
<li>'a' is any alphabetic character,</li>
<li>'x' is any alphanumeric character,</li>
<li>'n' is any digit (The first digit within the square brackets may be 
preceded with a plus or minus sign e.g. '+' or '-',</li>
<li>'*' is any character that is NOT alphanumeric,</li>
<li>'.' is any character<li>
</ul>
As mentioned above, a numerical value within square brackets is called an 'Index
value'. As shown above, the Index value 'n' can be preceded by '+' or '-' e.g.
[-2] or [2] or [+2]. Password Safe treats an index that equates to zero as
meaning the complete field.
</ul>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 width="90%">
 <colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="95%"></colgroup>
 <tr><th align="center">Notes</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">1</td><td>Directory values (appdir or dbdir) do not have an ending '\'.
  Remember to add this if you need it in your Execute String.</td></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">2</td><td>The contents of variables (including directory and full path
  values) may contain blanks. You may need to enclose the result in quotes in
  your Execute String for correct execution.</td></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">3</td><td>If the Notes field contains more than one line, it will include
  any embedded carraige return (CR) or line feed (LF). This may cause issues when executed as CR and/or LF
  will be taken as 'enter'.</td></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">4</td><td>Any trailing CR and/or LF are removed from single lines selected
  from the Notes field.</td></tr>
 <tr><td align="center">5</td><td>If the AutoType variable is present in the Execute string,
  AutoType will be performed once the target window is active. The variable and
  its value, if present, will be removed from the string that is executed. This
  variable can appear anywhere in the Execute String as it only specifies what
  Password Safe will do after the command string has been executed. Differing
  from other variables, this one will be able to take a value to override the
  entry's current value. The format is ($autotype can replace $a in the following
  examples):<br>
  <table  border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10>
   <colgroup><col width="20%"><col width="80%"></colgroup>
   <tr><td>$a</td><td>Use current entry value.</td></tr>
   <tr><td>${a}</td><td>Use current entry value (used if text immediately follows the '$a' variable).</td></tr>
   <tr><td>$a(value)</td><td>Use autotype string specified between the round brackets.</td></tr>
   <tr><td>${a}(value)</td><td>Use autotype string specified between the round brackets.</td></tr>
  </table>
  </td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Note:</b> Be sure to add quotes around your string if required e.g. if your
database directory contains spaces, to access a text file in it based on your
open database name, you would need the following (with quotes):<br>
'$dbdir\\$dbname.txt'<br>
Notice that the back-slash is escaped so that the '$dbname' is recognised as a
variable.</p>

<p>On Windows, the normal substitution of environmental variables
(specified as %variable_name%) is performed. For example:
'%windir%\notepad.exe' could become (depending on your installation)
'C:\Windows\notepad.exe'. Current values set in your environment can
be determined by running 'cmd.exe' and issuing the 'set' command without any 
parameters. Any unknown environmental variable is left unchanged in the 
execute string e.g. %xyz%\notepad.exe remains as %xyz%\notepad.exe if
variable 'xyz' is not set. Note: Windows environmental variables are not 
case sensitive.</p>

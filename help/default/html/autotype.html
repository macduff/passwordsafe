<h2>Auto Type</h2>
<p><b>Auto Type </b>provides a means for users to
easily and quickly
enter user name and password information. With a single click, the user
name and password are entered and the data is submitted to the host for
approval. By default, the formula followed by the automated keystrokes
is as follows: <a name="defautotext"></a>the user
name, followed by a tab key, followed by the
password, another tab, and then the enter key (<i>username</i>
<b>TAB</b> <i>password</i> <b>TAB </b><b>ENTER</b>).
This works fine for most web sites that require username/password
authentication.</p>
<p>For web sites or applications that require different data, it
is possible to
tailor the autotype behaviour as described in the <a href="#autotype_details">Customizing Auto Type</a>
section below. Note that you can also customize the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="#defautotext">default</a>&nbsp;</span>autotype
text via the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="misc_tab.html">Misc</a>. </span>tab in
the Options dialog box. This can be useful if, for example, the
autotype is too fast for your machine.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="instr">
<h3>Using Auto Type</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place cursor in the form's user name field</li>
<li>Maximize or open Password Safe</li>
<li>Select a password entry</li>
<li><b>Ctrl -T</b> or right-click and select <b>Perform
Auto Type</b> to or click on the Toolbar button to initiate.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="autotype_details"></a>Customizing
Auto Type</h3>
<p>For web sites or applications that do not have the username
field followed by
the
password field followed by the login button, you can modify the
behaviour by filling in the <a href="#N1">"Autotype" field</a>
with
text that
specifies the desired behavior as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\u</span>
is replaced by the username associated with the entry.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\p</span>
is replaced by the password associated with the entry.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\g</span>
is replaced by the group associated with the entry.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\i</span>
is replaced by the title associated with the entry.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\o</span>
is replaced by the contents of the (possibly multilined) Notes field.</li>
<ul>
<li>Any end of line characters
&#8216;\n&#8217;, &#8216;\r&#8217; or
&#8216;\r\n&#8217; are converted to &#8216;\r&#8217;
(carriage return).</li>
<li>No substitution is made to escape sequences within the
Notes field (e.g. &#8216;\u&#8217;, &#8216;\p&#8217;
etc.) except for the &#8216;\t&#8217; sequence which is
replaced by the tab character.</li>
</ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\o</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">NNN</span>
is replaced by the contents of the n<sup>th</sup> line of
the Notes field</li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">NNN </span>can
be one to three digits (e.g., \o5 for the 5<sup>th</sup>
line, \o45 for the 45<sup>th</sup>, etc.</li>
<li>End of line characters are <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span> included.</li>
<li>if <span style="font-style: italic;">NNN </span>is
larger than the number of lines in the notes field, then this has no
effect.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<hr> <small><b>Note</b> that this is a
convenient way to support
autotyping for applications that require a second password or other
arbitrary text as part of the authentication process.</small>
<hr> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\b</span>
is replaced by the backspace key.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\t</span>
is replaced by the Tab key, in effect skipping a field.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\n</span>
is replaced by the enter key, in effect pressing a button.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\\</span>
is replaced by the backslash (\) key.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\d<span style="font-style: italic;">NNN</span></span>
sets the delay between characters to <span style="font-style: italic;">NNN</span>
milliseconds,
instead of 10 (the default). This changes the delay for the current and
all subsequent characters. For example, "fast\d500slow" will result in
'fast' being typed with the dfault delay, and the letters 's', 'l',
'o', and 'w' typed with a half-second pause before each. if you want to
put in a one-time delay that does not affect the speed of the following
characters, use '\w' or '\W', as described below.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">\w</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">NNN </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">or </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">\WNNN </span>introduces a delay of <span style="font-style: italic;">NNN </span>milliseconds
for \w, or seconds if \W is used. For example, "how\w500now" will cause
'how' to be typed (at the default rate or that specified by the last
\d), followed by a half-second pause, followed by 'now' typed at the
same rate as 'how'). Likewise, "how\W2now" will introduce a two second
pause between the two words.</li><li>All other text is typed as-is.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</span>
The following can be used where the bank account number (12345) must be
entered before the user and password:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">12345\t\u\t\p\t\n</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></p>

<hr> <small><b>Notes:</b>&nbsp;<a name="N1">By default, the
Autotype field is not displayed in the Add or Edit dialog boxes.
To access the Autotype field, you may have to click on the
"More&gt;&gt;" button in the dialog box.<br>
<br>
If you are having problems with autotype, you might want to disable
3rd-party popup-blockers. Users have reported problems with the
interaction of popup-blockers with the autotype functionality.</a></small>

<h2>View Menu</h2>

<img alt="View Menu" src="images/view_menu.jpg">

<p>The <b>View Menu</b> controls the available display options. You can
switch between how your entries' user names and passwords are
organized: either as a single list (<b>Flattened List</b>) or organized by category
(<b>Nested Tree</b>).
You can choose whether or not to display a toolbar, and if so, if to
use the Classic or New Toolbar Icons. The toolbar itself is
customizable. You can also expand or collapse all the groups displayed
in the Nested Tree view, filter the entries displayed to match any
criteria, select the font in which the entries are displayed and
display reports of merge, compare, import and other advanced operations.</p>


<h3>Switching Between Nested Tree and Flattened List Views</h3>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <b>View</b> menu</li>
<li>Select <b>Nested Tree</b> or <b>Flattened List</b></li>
</ol>

<h3>Controlling the Toolbars</h3>

<p>To display or hide the toolbar, check or uncheck the <b>Toolbar Visible </b>menu item.<br>

To use "new" or "classic" toolbar icons, select the "<b>New toolbar</b>" or "<b>Classic toolbar</b>"
menu item, respectively.<br>

<p>The "<b>Dragbar</b>" is a special toolbar that allows you to paste 
parts of the currently selected entry by "dragging" the icon specifying 
the part you want to paste to the window that you want it to be pasted 
to. For example, to paste the "Notes" text of a given entry to another 
application using the dragbar, select the entry, and then drag the "N" 
icon from the dragbar to the application. When you release the left 
mouse button, the contents of the Notes field will be pasted to the 
application. The dragbar will disable ("grey out") icons for fields that 
are empty for the selected entry. The 'Autotype' image is slightly different
to the others in that dragging the image to an input area on another Window
(e.g. Browser) will cause <b>Password Safe</b> to begin Autotype from there.</p>

To display or hide the dragbar, check or uncheck the <b>Dragbar Visible</b> menu item.

<h3>Expand All</h3>

<p>Expands all groups, making all entries visible <i>(Nested Tree view only)</i>.</p>

<h3>Show unsaved changes</h3>

colour. See the next picture</p>

<p><img alt="Data with changes" src="images/tree_view_change.jpg"><br>Overview of all entries.</p>

<p><img alt="Data, only changes" src="images/tree_view_change_only.jpg"><br>Overview of all changed entries.</p>

<p><small>Note: As long as there are some unsaved items, there will be
a "*" in the status area at the bottom of the application's window.</small></p>

<h3>Show entries with Expiry dates</h3>

<p>If you select this menu item, only entries with an expiry date will
be shown in the list. It does not matter that the expiry date is in
the past or future.</p>

<p>If there aren't any entries with expiry date, this menu item will
be grayed out.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>

<p>A "filter" is a criteria (or set of criteria) that an entry either matches or doesn't
match. <b>Password Safe</b> allows
you to define filters, and display only those entries that matches a
given filter. For more information on defining and using filters, see
<a href="filters.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Change Font</h3>

<p>Select a different font for displaying entries in the List or Tree
views, and for displaying passwords in the Add and Edit Entry dialog
boxes.</p>

<h3>Reports</h3>

<p>View the results of merge, compare, import and validate operations.</p>

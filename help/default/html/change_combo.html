    <h2>Changing Master Passwords</h2>
    <img alt="Key Change dialog box" src="images/combo_change.jpg">
    <p>To change a master password ("Safe Combination"), first open up
      the database whose
      password you wish to change. Once opened, go to the <b>Manage</b>
      menu and select <b>Change Safe Combination</b>. <br>
    </p>
    This window allows you to add or remove YubiKey authentication, add
    or remove additional password authentication, as well as switch the
    YubiKey that is used to access the current database. Following are
    instructions for each of these actions:<br>
    <h3>Adding YubiKey Authentication</h3>
    To convert a Password Safe database that is accessed using a Master
    Password (Safe Combination) to YubiKey access:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter the current Master Password in the Old Safe Combination
        field</li>
      <li>Insert you YubiKey</li>
      <li>If you wish, enter (and confirm) a password in the New Safe
        Combination and Confirmation fields.</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>lower </strong>Yubikey button, and then
        activate your YubiKey.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Removing YubiKey Authentication <br>
    </h3>
    To change the PasswordSafe database so that it is only protected by
    a master password:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert your YubiKey</li>
      <li>If you currently have a password associated with this
        database, enter it in the Old Safe Combination field</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>upper </strong>Yubikey button, and then
        activate your YubiKey</li>
      <li>Set the New Safe Combination (and the Confirmation) to the
        desired value.</li>
      <li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Adding/Removing/Changing Password Authentication <br>
    </h3>
    Password Safe can use YubiKey as the only access mechanism, or along
    with a conventional password. To change from one to another:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert your YubiKey</li>
      <li>If you currently have a password associated with this
        database, enter it in the Old Safe Combination field</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>upper </strong>Yubikey button, and then
        activate your YubiKey</li>
      <li>Set the New Safe Combination (and the Confirmation) to the
        desired value: Blank to remove the password, or a new password
        to add or replace the password.</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>lower </strong>Yubikey button, and then
        activate your YubiKey.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Changing YubiKeys</h3>
    To switch from one YubiKey to another:
    <ol>
      <li>Insert the old YubiKey</li>
      <li>If you have a password associated with this database as well,
        enter it in the Old Safe Combination field</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>upper </strong>Yubikey button, and then
        activate your YubiKey</li>
      <li>Remove the old YubiKey, insert the new one</li>
      <li>If you wish, enter (and confirm) a password in the New Safe
        Combination and Confirmation fields.</li>
      <li>Click on the <strong>lower </strong>Yubikey button, and then
        activate your YubiKey.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p><b>Password Safe</b> has a built in check for what it considers
      to
      be weak master passwords. In general, a master password (like any
      password) should consist of mixed case characters with at least
      one
      number or <a href="javascript:popup.TextPopup(strSpecialChars,popFont,9,9,-1,-1)">special
        character</a> (such
      as those found above the number keys on a keyboard). If a master
      password is entered that the program considers weak, it will
      prompt for
      confirmation. You may the option to accept the originally
      entered (weak) password, or to enter a new one.</p>
    <hr> <small><b>Notes:</b></small><br>
    <ul>
      <li><small><b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">There is no
              mechanism within
              Password Safe to retrieve lost or forgotten safe passwords</span></b><span
            style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">.<br>
          </span>This is a deliberate design decision, since any
          mechanism for
          retrieving lost passwords poses a security hole that can be
          exploited.</small></li>
      <li><small>Please choose a difficult-to-guess password. A trivial
          password, such as "password" or your name is easy to guess,
          and negates
          the security that <b>Password Safe</b> provides.<br>

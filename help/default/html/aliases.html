<h3>Password Aliases</h3>
<p>If you're using a "single sign-on" system that allows you to share
the same password across different machines/servers/applications, etc.
you can setup <span style="font-weight: bold;">Password Safe</span> entries accordingly, so that changing one password affects all other related entries. This is called "aliasing" entries.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The basic idea is to allow one entry's password to be referred to by another. The "referred to" entry&nbsp;
is called the <span style="font-weight: bold;">base</span>, and the "referring" entry (or entries) is (are) called the <span style="font-weight: bold;">alias(es)</span>.
When an entry is set to be the alias of another entry, the alias's
password effectively "follows" that entry's password: If you copy the
aliase's password to the clipboard, the password that gets copied is
the base's. If you change the base's password, this is immeidately
reflected in all the alias entries associated with the base. Although
this may sound complicated, in fact it's quite simple and intuitive to
use. The hardest part is setting up the aliases, as described below.</p>
<h4>Defining an alias</h4>
<p>In Password Safe, an entry can refer to another's password by means
of a specially formatted password in the referring entry. The format is
the "name" of the referred-to entry enclosed in square brackets. "Name"
in this context means all of the following fields that make an entry
unique: Group, title and user name. If the title is unique, then the
other fields don't need to be specified. Likewise, if the group and
title together specify a unique entry, then the user doesn't have to be
specified. In any case, the fields are separated by colons. The
following examples should make this clear.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>1. If the base entry's title is "LDAP Server", and there are no
other entries with that title, then an alias will be defined by an
entry that has "[LDAP Server]" in the password field.</p>
<p>2. If there are "LDAP Server" entries in two different groups, say
"Dept. A" and "Dept. B", then one can specify an alias to the latter by
"[Dept. A:LDAP Server:]" (Note the colon on the right followed by the
right bracket, signifying that the username isn't specified in this
case).</p>
<p>3. Different user names can also be used to differentiate between
similar base entries, e.g., "[:LDAP Server:Joe]" and "[:LDAP
Server:Mary]".</p>
<p>4. Finally, all three fields may be specified, as in "[Dept. A:LDAP Server:Joe]"</p>
<h4>Display</h4>
<p>Base entries, that is, entries with at least one alias "pointing" to
them, are displayed with a green triangle instead of a green square in
the nested tree view.Alias entries are shown with white triangles. All this is shown below: </p>

<h2>Explorer View</h2>

<p>As well as the previous Tree and List views, an Explorer view is now available.
This has a Tree view of only groups in the left hand pane (LHP) and the right hand pane (RHP)
shows a similar view of all the groups and entries within the group selected in the
left hand pane.</p>

<p>In a similar manner to the Windows Explorer actions, a single click on a group in
the LHP will display its contents in the RHP. A double click on a group in the LHP will
do the same but will also expand the group structure in the LHP. A double click on a group
in the RHP will display the contents in the RHP and update the currently selected group
in the LHP.</p>

<p>In this view, there are back and forward buttons on the Status Bar. Use the Back button
and the Forward button to navigate to other groups you've already displayed. The current path
to this displayed group is shown to the right on the Dragbar. When initially selected, the
root of the database is displayed in the both the LHP and RHP and shown on the Dragbar.</p>

<p>Unlike the Windows Explorer, once in the Explorer view, the view can be split (View menu "Split"
or shortcut F6) and once split, it can be removed (View menu "Remove Split" also shortcut F6). When
the split is actioned, the lower two panes reflect the current path displayed in the upper two panes.
Once split, the two lower panes behave independently to the upper panes. When the split is removed,
it is always the lower panes closed. The path displayed in the current RHP that is selected (or has
focus) is displayed in the path on the Dragbar.</p>

<p>In the List view, it is possible to select two entries and compare them via the Edit menu or via
the right-click context menu on either entry. In the Explorer view, it is possible to select
two entries in the RHP to compare. When the view is split, it is possible to select
two entries in the upper RHP, one in the upper RHP and one in the lower RHP or two in the lower
RHP to compare.</p>

<p><b><u>Coded but totally untested</u></b> It is possible to use Drag & Drop in Explorer view.
If dragging from the LHP, then only one group may be selected. If dragging from the RHP, then any
number of groups and/or entries may be selected. Entries and/or groups and their contents may be
dragged between panes and between different instances of PasswordSafe. In the latter case, the target
instance can be in the Tree or Explorer view.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>The following functions are not available when in the new Explorer view as they are
inappropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>The View menu "Show Unsaved Changes" and "Show entries with Expiry dates".</li>
<li>User defined filters.</li>
</ul>

<h3>KNOWN ISSUES</h3>

<ul>
<li>Drag & Drop HAS multiple issues - but then untested so please do not report any found!</LI>
</ul>

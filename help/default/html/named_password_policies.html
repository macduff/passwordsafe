<h2>Named Password Policies</h2>

<p>In addition to defining a default password generation policy for a database
(see <a href="password_policies.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Password Policy"</a>)
and allow an entry to have its own specific password policy, V3.28 and later
provide the facility to create <b>Named Password Policies</b> via the
"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Password Policies..." menu item.  These are database specific
and are stored in the database header.</p>

<p>Via this dialog, one can view the current database default password policy and
create, edit or delete any new "Named" policies.  Note: You cannot edit the
current database default password policy - you must use the
"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Password Policy" dialog to do this.
Also, you cannot delete a named policy that is being used by at least one entry in
the database.  You can use the PasswordSafe filter function
"View&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Filters" to show all entries using a given Named password policy.</p>

<p>The Add/Edit entry function and the "Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Generate Password"
function have both been updated to allow an entry to use a named policy or to allow
the generation of a random password using a Named policy.  One reason to keep unused
Named Password Policies is to allow them to to be used only to generate random passwords.</p>

<h2>XML and Text Import/Export</h2>

<p> When a database is exported to XML (whether it is a specific subset of the
entries in the database or the whole database), <u>all</u> the <b>Named Password
Policies</b> in the current database are also exported.  During the subsequent import of
that XNL file, all the <b>Named Pasword Policies</b> are also imported into the current
database.  If a <b>Named Password Policy</b> of the same name already exists in
the current database and it has the same policy settings as that being imported, then it
will be used by any entries referencing it when they are imported.  However, if the
imported <b>Named Password Policy</b> has different policy settings to that in the
database with the same name, then the policy will be imported with the words
"Imported - <i>datetime</i>" appended to its name (where the '<i>datetime</i>' is the
date/time of the Import) and all imported entries refering to it will now reference
the newly named policy.</p>

<p>When importing a XML file, if the any record references a Named Password
Policy that does not exist in the current database (or in the XML file being imported),
then the entry will be changed to use the current database default policy.  Warning messages
will be placed in the Import log show which entries have been affected.</p>

<p>When exporting to a Text file, the name of of any referenced Named Password Policy
is also exported.  However, there is no facility to also export the values contained in
these <b>Named Password Policies</b>.</p>

<p>Due to the above restriction, when importing a Text file, if the any record
references a Named Password Policy that does not exist in the current database,
then the entry will be changed to use the current database default policy.  Warning messages
will be placed in the Import log show which entries have been affected.</p>

<h2>Merge and Drag &amp; Drop</h2>

<p>When a whole or subset of a database is merged into the current database, any
<b>Named Password Policy</b> referenced by the entries being merged will be brought
across from the source database. If a <b>Named Password Policy</b> of the same name
already exists in the current database and it has the same policy settings as that being
copied across, then it will be used by any entries referencing is are merged.  However,
if the imported <b>Named Password Policy</b> has different policy settings to that in
the database with the same name, then it will be imported with the word
"Merged - <i>datetime</i>" appended to its name (where the '<i>datetime</i>' is the
date/time of the Merge) and all entries refering to it will now reference the newly
named policy.</p>

<p>Similarly, when one or more entries are dragged from another database and dropped into
the current database except "Drag - <i>datetime</i>" will be used to make the
<b>Named Password Policy</b> unique.</p>

<h2>Creating and Opening a Safe</h2>

<p><b>Password Safe</b> allows users to store all passwords in a single
"safe" (password database), or to create multiple databases for
different purposes (e.g., one for work, one for personal use). Each database
is independent can be moved and used on different systems, as long as the same
version of <b>Password Safe</b> is installed. Databases are encrypted with
an encryption key derived from the master password (the master password, however,
is <b>not</b> kept in the database in any form).</p>

<p>If you are using <b>Password Safe</b> for the first time, press the
New Database button. You will be asked to choose the name and location
of your password database (the default, "pwsafe.psafe3", is fine).
Afterwards, you will be prompted to enter a master password that is used
to encrypt and lock the contents of your new safe.</p>

<h3>Create a New Database</h3>

<p>There are two ways that a new database can be created. By clicking <b>New Database</b>
from the <b>Safe Combination Entry</b> dialog when the program is started, or from the
<b>"File&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;New Database"</b> menu once <b>Password Safe</b> has been opened.
Using either method causes the <b>Safe Combination Set Up</b> dialog to appear.</p>

<hr>
<small><b>Note:</b> By default, <b>Password Safe</b> will
show the database last used, and displays a combination prompt for
it. If you use several databases, you can choose between them using the
drop-down list. Alternately, you can type in the path to the database
to open, or select it from a File dialog box by pressing on the
ellipsis ("...") button. Once a database is open, you can change to
another via the <b>Open Database</b> command from the <b>File Menu</b>.</small>

<h3>Virtual keyboard</h3>

<p>To setup a master password in a secure way, you could use character (e.g. on a German keyboard)
as <b>&auml;</b>, <b>&ouml;</b> or simular. To realize the input of such characters, you would
need a foreign keyboard. Such a keyboard is available as a virtual keyboard. This keyboard
is then used to simulate all available foreign characters. The virtual keyboard can be shown
by pushing the symbol <span><img alt="Symbol virtual keyboard" src="images/vk_small.jpg"></span>.
Foreign characters, that are not available at the physical keyboard, can be put in in this way.
So you can build your desired master password. Even pieces of the master password can be build this way.</p>

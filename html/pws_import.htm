    <p>PasswordSafe allows you to import password information from
    text files. These files may be generated by other applications,
    exported from a spreadsheet, or even written by hand using Notepad
    or another text editor.</p>
    <p> The text file consists of one or more entries, each on one or
    more lines. Each entry consist of the following fields:
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Group and Title</span> - For example Finance.Bank.BangForBuck. If the
    entry is to be under the top level (i.e., no group), then there
    should be no periods in the name (periods separate groups).
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">User</span> - The name of the user associated with this entry. If you
    want to use the default name, this should be empty.
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Password</span> - The actual password.
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes</span> - If the note is more than a single word, it needs to be
    between double quotes ("like this"). A note may span more than a
    singleline, as long as it is terminated with a double quote.
</li></ul>

<p>The settings that are configurable in the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Import Text Settings</span>"
dialog box are as follows:
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Field separator:</span> By default, the fields of an entry are separated
by a tab character. You can change this to a comma (,), which is the
default separator for some spreadsheet export functions, or to an
arbitrary character, via "Other".
</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Import under group?</span> If you're importing entries to a new database,
you probably want them under the top level of the tree. Otherwise, you
might want to set this to import all the entries under a specified node.
</li></ul>

<p> After pressing OK on the "Import Text Settings" dialog box, you
  will be prompted for the name of the text file. At the end of the
  import process, a small dialog box appears, showing how may entries
  were added, and how many (if any) were unsuccessfully parsed.

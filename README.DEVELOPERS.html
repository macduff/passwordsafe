<title>Readme For Developers or Others wishing to compile Password Safe</title>

<h1>Developer Notes</h1>

<h3>Additional Software Requirements</h3>
<p>In order to build the Windows version of Password Safe, you need to install
the following freely available components:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&DisplayLang=en">Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop</a> (for online help support)</li>
<li><a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads">Tortoise SVN Client</a> (for updating the revision number within Password Safe's version details)</li>
<li>For XML Support, one or more of the following is needed:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=993C0BCF-3BCF-4009-BE21-27E85E1857B1&displaylang=en">Microsoft's XML V6.0 SDK [File: "msxml6_SDK.msi" on this page]</a></li>
<li><a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat's V2.0.1 XML Library</a></li>
<li><a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/">Xerces V3.0.0 XML Library</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>If you're using Microsoft's Visual Studio, the file "<font color=red>UserVariables.vsprops</font>" for the Windows MFC application and "<font color=red>wxUserVariables.vsprops</font>" for the Windows wxWidgets application 
<b><u><i>must</i></u></b> exist and point to the directories where the above
components have been installed. <b><u><i>The solution will not open correctly without
this file being present.</i></u></b></p>

<p>For your convenience, we've included two simple Visual Basic scripts, 
"<font color=red>configure.vbs</font>" and "<font color=red>wxconfigure.vbs</font>", that you can run to generate the "UserVariables.vsprops" file and the "wxUserVariables.vsprops" file respectively with the correct values.</p>

<h3>XML Processing</h3>
<p>Originally, PasswordSafe used Microsoft's XML library 
for XML parsing and validation. For portability, we're now working on support
for the Expat and Xerces XML libraries, which are available for non-Windows
platforms.  See their web sites for more information.  Note: Xerces V3.0.0 
at revision 707374 or greater is needed to correct a memory leak processing 
password history entries.</p>

<p>To determine which XML library to use while building PasswordSafe,
we've defined a new preprocessor variable (USE_XML_LIBRARY). If <u>NOT</u>
defined, the compiled Password Safe <u>will not process XML files</u>
(databases or filter definitions in XML format). Filters within a
database will be treated as 'Unknown Fields' and will remain unchanged
so that other versions of Password Safe that do support XML parsing
can still use them. Note, however, that the application will be able
to write XML files.</p>

<p>The three valid values of the USE_XML_LIBRARY variable are "EXPAT", "MSXML"
and "XERCES" corresponding to the three different implementations.</p>

<p>Password Safe uses SAX2 processing for both Microsoft's and the Xerces'
XML Parsers, which are full validating parsers and require the presence of
the appropriate XSD Schema file (included in the distribution and in the "xml"
sub-directorty, to process either file or filter imports.  This ensures
that the data eventually hitting the SAX2 content handlers is correct and just
needs placing in the appropriate fields.</p>

<p>Expat is a non-validating XML Parser and uses its own API rather than SAX2.
Note: SAX2 is only an official standard for Java XML processing, although many C
supporting parsers also support this interface.  Because Expat is
non-validating, code is being added directly into Password Safe to
perform this validation, so that the program and its databases are
not corrupted by poorly formed XML or incorrect data within the XML file.</p>
